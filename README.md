# PigDiceGame

Pig is a simple single-player dice game where the objective is to reach a total score of 20 or more points. The game is played with a six-sided die. Players can roll the die multiple times during their turn but must make strategic decisions about whether to keep rolling or hold their current score.

## Game Rules

1. Game Start: The game begins with the player having a total score of 0.

2. Rolling the Die:
   - If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends immediately, and they lose all points for that turn.
   - If the player rolls a number between 2 and 6, they can choose to either:
     - Roll Again: Add the rolled value to the turn score and continue playing.
     - Hold: Add the turn score to their total score, ending their turn.
